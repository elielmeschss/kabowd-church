# Kabowd Church APP

This project is created for information maintenance and administrative control of a church.

It has an institutional website on its main page, in addition to a management panel for members and directors.

## Members

Members can check the transparency of the treasury, they can also consult projects and apply, in addition to following calendars and meetings, participating in courses and devotions.

## Directors 

For Directors, they can access the transparency of the cashier, can access meetings and internal minutes, manage the front side of the website, access the web radio as well as start programs, can feed the agendas, provide information and create devotionals.

This application was created to be fed at all times both in administrative and institutional matters and information.

The base of the project was thought to be fast, functional and practical.
